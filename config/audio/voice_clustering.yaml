# Voice Clustering Configuration
# Optimized for Pokemon anime character voice separation - FIXED CLUSTER APPROACH

embedding:
  # Voice embedding model for speaker verification
  model: "speechbrain/spkrec-ecapa-voxceleb"  # Pre-trained speaker embedding model
  # consider using model: "microsoft/wavlm-base-plus-sv"  # WavLM model, better for speaker verification

  device: "cuda"  # Use GPU if available, fallback to CPU
  normalize: true  # Normalize embeddings for better clustering
  max_audio_length: 10.0  # Maximum seconds per segment for embedding extraction
  min_audio_length: 3.0   # INCREASED - filter very short clips (was 2.0)

clustering:
  # Clustering algorithm and parameters - CONSERVATIVE SEPARATION
  algorithm: "dbscan"          # Switch to DBSCAN for more precise separation
  
  # Hierarchical clustering parameters - BACKUP
  n_clusters: 25               # Much higher if hierarchical is used
  linkage: "ward"              # Linkage method for hierarchical clustering
  
  # DBSCAN parameters - MODERATE SEPARATION (less data loss)
  eps: 0.35                    # Slightly higher - capture more similar voices
  min_samples: 8               # Lower requirement - include more segments
  distance_metric: "cosine"    # Distance metric for voice embeddings

quality:
  # Quality filters for meaningful clusters - MORE PERMISSIVE FOR SMALLER CLUSTERS
  min_cluster_duration: 30.0    # Lower duration requirement 
  min_episodes_per_cluster: 3   # Fewer episodes required
  min_segments_per_cluster: 10  # Lower segment count for more clusters
  purity_threshold: 0.4         # More permissive purity

character_assignment:
  # Character assignment and validation - IMPROVED SENSITIVITY
  use_text_analysis: true       # Use transcript text for character hints
  min_confidence: 0.3           # Lower confidence threshold for more assignments
  
  # Expected Pokemon characters - CORE MAIN CHARACTERS ONLY
  pokemon_characters:
    - "ash"           # Main protagonist (most dialogue)
    - "misty"         # Main character 
    - "brock"         # Main character
    - "jessie"        # Team Rocket (frequent recurring)
    - "james"         # Team Rocket (frequent recurring)
    - "meowth"        # Team Rocket (frequent recurring)
    - "narrator"      # Common across episodes
    - "pok√©dex"       # Common across episodes

text_analysis:
  # Text-based character hints (optional enhancement)
  enabled: true
  
  # Character-specific phrases and patterns
