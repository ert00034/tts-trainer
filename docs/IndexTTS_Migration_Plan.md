# Backwards compatibility layer
class TTSModelFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_model(model_type: str, **kwargs):
        if model_type == "indextts":
            return IndexTTSTrainer(**kwargs)
        elif model_type == "xtts_v2":
            return XTTSTrainer(**kwargs)
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown model type: {model_type}")
