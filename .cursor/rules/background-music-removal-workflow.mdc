# Background Music Removal Workflow Rule

## CRITICAL PREREQUISITE FOR TRAINING

### ❌ NEVER suggest training without background music removal first

When working with TV shows, anime, or any content with background music (like Pokemon episodes), **ALWAYS** require background music removal before training.

### Required Workflow Order

1. **FIRST: Remove Background Music**
   ```bash
   python main.py remove-background-music --install  # First time only
   python main.py remove-background-music             # Process validation samples
   ```

2. **THEN: Train with clean audio**
   ```bash
   python main.py train --model xtts_v2 --dataset manual_refs.txt
   ```

### When to Enforce This Rule

#### ALWAYS Required For:
- Pokemon episodes and anime content
- TV shows with constant background music
- Movies with musical soundtracks
- Any content where background music is audible during dialogue

#### Detection Keywords:
- "Pokemon", "anime", "TV show", "episode"
- "background music", "music in background"
- "training quality issues", "raspy voices", "artifacts"
- Files from [resources/validation_samples_v4/](mdc:resources/validation_samples_v4)
- References to [manual_refs.txt](mdc:manual_refs.txt)

### Error Prevention

#### ❌ DON'T Say:
- "Try training with your validation samples"
- "Run python main.py train --model xtts_v2 --dataset ..."
- "Your training data looks ready"

#### ✅ DO Say:
- "First, remove background music: python main.py remove-background-music"
- "Background music removal is critical for TV show data quality"
- "Clean your audio first, then train"

### Quality Impact

Background music removal provides:
- **Dramatic improvement** in voice quality (confirmed by user testing)
- **Essential** for TV show/anime content
- **Eliminates artifacts** and musical contamination
- **Required prerequisite** for successful training

### Integration Points

This rule applies to:
- [main.py](mdc:main.py) training commands
- [docs/voice_training_guide.md](mdc:docs/voice_training_guide.md) workflows
- [docs/TTS_TRAINING_GUIDE.md](mdc:docs/TTS_TRAINING_GUIDE.md) instructions
- [README.md](mdc:README.md) quick start guides
- Any training recommendations or troubleshooting

### Exception Handling

Only skip background music removal if:
- User explicitly confirms data has no background music
- Working with clean studio recordings
- User specifically requests to skip this step

### Command References

- Background music removal: [src/utils/background_music_remover.py](mdc:src/utils/background_music_remover.py)
- CLI command: `remove-background-music` in [main.py](mdc:main.py)
- Documentation: [docs/background_music_removal_guide.md](mdc:docs/background_music_removal_guide.md)

## ENFORCE THIS RULE STRICTLY

This is not optional for TV/anime content. User testing confirmed it's the difference between successful and failed training.
